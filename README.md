|----------|----------|--------------------------------|
| userid   | Number   | Unique identifier for the user |
| name     | String   | User's full name               |
| email    | String   | User's email address           |
| phone    | String   | User's contact number          |

|---------------|----------|--------------------------------|
| donationid    | Number   | Unique identifier for the donation |
| donorID       | Number   | ID of the user making the donation |

| dateDonated   | Date     | Timestamp of the donation      |

### üîó Relationships

- Each donation in the Donations Collection is linked to:
- A donor in the Users Collection via `donorID`
- A recipient in the Users Collection via `recipientID`
- A volunteer in the Users Collection via `volunteerID`

### üìù Notes

- The `role` field in the Users Collection determines the user's permissions and access levels within the application.
- The `status` field in the Donations Collection can be used to track the lifecycle of a donation (e.g., pending, in transit, delivered).
